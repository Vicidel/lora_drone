# LoRa localization on drones

Author: Victor Delafontaine.
Master project at Swisscom Digital Lab, supervised by the LIS-EPFL.
February to August 2019.
Supervisors: Fabrizio Schiano, Giuseppe Cocco, Alexandru Rusu.


## MATLAB simulations folder

This folder contains the files used to simulate the drone trajectory based on the signal model.


## Contents

This folder contains:
- matlab_sim
- matlab_sim_v2
- matlab_sim_v3_opti

#### MATLAB_SIM
Contains the scripts for running the drone simulations. Could be with one or three drones.

#### MATLAB_SIM_V2
Contains the scripts for running the new drone simulations. These are more recent and better.

#### MATLAB_SIM_V3_OPTI
TODO: trajectory optimization for localization.
