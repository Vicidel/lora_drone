Two things to test: one or three drones

One drone:
	Follows the gradient of signal strength and finds the best
		+: 
		-: 
	Moves in three positions and do trilateration measures
		+: precise
		-: moving takes time
    Continuously moves and make measures
        +: no time loss due to measures
        -: can only do one measure so noisy

Three drones:
	Trilateration from three positions around network estimate
		+: precise and fast
		-: requires three drones
