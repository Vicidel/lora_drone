This commands run the C++ script located in catkin_ws/src/mavros/mavros/src/offb_node.cpp
The drone moves in the Gazebo window according to the script
We can spectate the simulation from QGC (terminal 4)

	Terminal 1:
		cd src/Firmware
		make px4_sitl gazebo

	Terminal 2:
		cd
		roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@14580" 
		// the numbers are obtained from terminal 1 
		// (cf http://discuss.px4.io/t/interfacing-mavros-with-gazebo-sitl/1552/5)

	Terminal 3:
		cd catkin_ws
		rosrun mavros offb_node

	Terminal 4 (optional):
		cd QGroundControl
		./QGroundControl.AppImage

To compile the offboard example after a modification:
In terminal 3:
	catkin build mavros
	source devel/setup.bash
