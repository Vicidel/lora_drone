Notes on how to run...


Raspberry PI
	RPi needs to be connected to Pixhawk via serial
	ssh pi@192.168.1.134 (note: could change IP)
	password is alex1234
	sudo screen -x
	if screen is not running:
		mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyS0 --aircraft MyCopter --baudrate 921600 --out 192.168.1.134:14550
	gibberish can come, if so "set shownoise false"
--> result of this is a MAVPROXY running with "MANUAL> "

PX4 + SITL + Gazebo + ROS master
	should start with opening of new terminal
	launches simulation with Iris inside of it
--> Gazebo is running

MAVROS
	roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@192.168.1.134:14550" 	// on RPi (does not work...)
	roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:="udp://:14540@14580"   // on SITL
--> don't know exactly what is does...

Offboard project
	cd catkin_ws
	catkin build mavros
	source devel/setup.bash
	rosrun mavros offb_node
--> runs the offb_node.cpp in catkin_ws/src/mavros/mavros/src/
