20190212_database
	contains testing things
	mostly junk to test functioning of server app and message system

20190214_1458_database
	first real data, distances corrupted (B2 instead of 32 -> distances of 178...)
	usable for testing matlab functions only

20190215am_allSF
	measure at all distances (10 -> 200), ~50 at each
	at 10m is too small, probably due antenna placement...
	at 150m abnormal spike up 

20190215am_SF7
	same but only with SF=7

20190215pm_antenna45 20190215pm_antennaup 20190215pm_antennahor
	experiments to know which antenna orientation is the best for which distance
	~70 at each distance (5mn)
	distances from 10 to 150 (ignore 200, data does not arrive...)
	antenna angled upward (up), at 45 degrees in direction of node (45) and horizontaly in the direction of the node (hor)
	
20190218_antenna_node
	test with 10m and antenna of node vert, 45 and hor
	stored as 10, 20 and 50m

20190218pm_antenna_node_hor 20190218pm_antenna_node_45
	experiments to decide which orientation of NODE antenna is best
	use 20190215pm_antenna45 as upward orientation for node antenna
	~60 at each distances (4mn)
	distances from 10 to 150 (ignore 200, data does not arrive...)

20190219pm_data
	collection of always 200 sent messages from each location

20190306pm_torus_horizontal 
	data collection for torus shape
	every 45° approximately for horizontal data, from 0 to 315°

20190307am_torus_indoor (et v2, v3, v4)
	same experiment as previous, but indoor
	for v2, no movement to test if same spike at 300s --> no
	for v3, two complete rotations (720° total)
	for v4, static for more than 300s
	for v5, in opposite direction
	for v6, with Micha TXpow set
	for v7, again without Micha stuff to check
