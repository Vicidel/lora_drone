	contains testing things
	mostly junk to test functioning of server app and message system

20190214_1458_database
	first real data, distances corrupted (B2 instead of 32 -> distances of 178...)
	usable for testing matlab functions only

20190215am_allSF
	measure at all distances (10 -> 200), ~50 at each
	at 10m is too small, probably due antenna placement...
	at 150m abnormal spike up 

20190215am_SF7
	same but only with SF=7

20190215pm_antenna45 20190215pm_antennaup 20190215pm_antennahor
	experiments to know which antenna orientation is the best for which distance
	~70 at each distance (5mn)
	distances from 10 to 150 (ignore 200, data does not arrive...)
	antenna angled upward (up), at 45 degrees in direction of node (45) and horizontaly in the direction of the node (hor)
