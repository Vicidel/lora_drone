Welcome to the pylocus documentation !
======================================

pylocus is a Python package designed to solve general localization problems, :math:`min_X L(X)`,
where :math:`X` is a :math:`N` x :math:`d` matrix of coordinates of a point set and
:math:`L(X)` is a cost function adapted to the problem at hand. 

The goal is to find the best location of all or some points in :math:`X`. Usually, the cost function penalizes the difference between measured and reconstructed signals, such as range, direction or other modalities. 

Note that for now, this documentation is written as a convenient entry point to understand the code structure. For detailed instructions on how to use particular function, please dig into the source code.  

Source code is on GitHub : https://github.com/LCAV/pylocus.
